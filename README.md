For this exercise an analysis was conducted on school district data detailing information on types of schools, number of students per school, and total budgets. This was done by merging 2 source CSV files, one with school information and the other with student specific information. 
After combining the source files into a full data frame, more points were added including average test scores for different subjects and spend per student at each school. This was done at the individual school granularity. 
A final comparison was done to determine if we could find any trends based on school size, spend per student, and school type. This dataset shows that in this specific school district, there was on average overall higher passing scores for less spend per student and smaller schools. This would be an interesting starting point to determine other factors that can impact passing scores. A limit to this data is that this is only one school district observed so it may not be representative enough to determine that in most cases less spend per student or smaller schools would correlate to higher test scores.
